The file assignment.cpp consists of the code for Pass 1 and Pass 2 of a two pass assembler.
The input file is by the name "input.txt".
In order to run the code, kindly ensure that the folder contains optab.txt.
To compile and run, type in the terminal:
	
	g++ assignment.cpp

This generates a file called intermediate_file.txt, and a file called output.txt, 
both of which are also present in the submission folder for reference.
